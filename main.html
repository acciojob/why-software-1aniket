		<h1 class="athiti-bold">Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
		<p class="athiti-regular">I want to be a developer because I truly enjoy solving problems and bringing ideas to life through code. Programming allows me to combine creativity with logic, and I find immense satisfaction in building something tangible that can positively impact people's lives or improve processes.

Additionally, technology evolves rapidly, and being a developer offers constant opportunities to learn and grow, which aligns perfectly with my love for continuous self-improvement. I see this role as a way to channel my technical skills, explore innovative solutions, and contribute meaningfully to a team and an organization.

Ultimately, I aspire to create software that not only meets technical requirements but also delivers value to users and the company, making the journey of being a developer both fulfilling and exciting.</p>
